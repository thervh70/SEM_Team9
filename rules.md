## Rules

##### Commit

- Mention issue number in commit message (if available)

- Check if build passes

- Update issue if needed

- By default: commit to branch other than master (some exceptions accepted)

##### Pull request

- Never close your own pull request!

- Name the pull request with WIP and link the branch

- Remove WIP if the branch if finished

- Only merge succeeding builds
